# PerfView
PerfView is a performance-analysis tool that helps isolate CPU- and memory-related performance issues.

The PerfVIew executable is ultimately published at the [PerfView download Site](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28567). 

There are [PerfView video tutorials](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/PerfView-Tutorial).   As well as [Vance Morrison's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vancem/archive/tags/perfview) which give you docs. 

The PerfView users guide is part of the application itself, however you can get at the .HTM file for it in the users guide in the soruce code itself at [/PerfView/SupportDlls/UsersGuide.htm](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/blob/master/src/PerfView/SupportDlls/UsersGuide.htm).
