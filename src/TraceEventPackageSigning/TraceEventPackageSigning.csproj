  <!-- This project is here only to support MicroBuild Signing of the Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent package.
       In theory this could be rold into the TraceEvent.csproj project, but after several attempts  (the last
       of which were that the fact that we build for several frameworks, makes it so that it can't seem to load
       the microbuild package from the PackageReference element propertly.   If we care we can make another
       attempt, but this should get us unblocked.   See issue https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/issues/673 for more.
