# The Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent Library



* [TraceEvent Programmers Guide](./TraceEventProgrammersGuide.md) - To understand the 
basic architecture and usefulness from a programmer's perspective. 

* Samples - There are a number of useful samples on github at
```  
    https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/tree/master/src/TraceEvent/Samples
``` 
If you download the PerfView repositotry you can build the TraceEventSamples.csproj which 
will build all the samples.  The TraceEvent\Samples directory is self contained 
(you can build that directory independently of anything else)

* Release Notes - the [Releases](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/releases) page 
for PerfView also shows the releases for the TraceEvent library.   Note that PerfView's 
version numbers and TraceEvent Version numbers are not kept in lock step. 
The version numbers that begin with T are for TraceEvent, the ones with P coorespond to PerfView.
